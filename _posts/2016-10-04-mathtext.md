If a Poisson point process has a constant parameter, say, $$\textstyle \lambda$$, then it is called a
homogeneous or stationary Poisson point process. The parameter, called ''rate'' or ''intensity'', is related
to the expected (or average) number of Poisson points existing in some bounded region.
In fact, the parameter $$\textstyle \lambda$$ can be interpreted as the average number of points per some unit
of extent such as length, area, volume, or time, depending on the underlying mathematical space,  hence it is
sometimes called the ''mean density''; the extent is sometimes called the ''exposure''.

## Defined on  the real line

Consider two real numbers $$\textstyle a$$ and $$\textstyle b$$, where $$\textstyle a\le b$$, and which may
represent points in time. Denote by $$\textstyle N(a,b]$$ the random number of points of a homogeneous Poisson
point  process existing with values greater than $$\textstyle a$$ but less than or equal to $$\textstyle b$$, or
in other words, the number of points of the process in the interval $$\textstyle (a,b]$$.  If the points form or
belong to a homogeneous Poisson process with  parameter $$\textstyle \lambda>0$$, then the probability of
$$\textstyle n$$ points existing in the above interval $$\textstyle (a,b]$$ is given by:

$$
   P\{N(a,b]=n\}=\frac{[\lambda(b-a)]^n}{n!}e^{-\lambda (b-a)},
$$

In other words, $$\textstyle N(a,b]$$ is a Poisson random variable with mean $$\textstyle \lambda(b-a)$$.
Furthermore, the number of points in any two disjoint intervals, say, $$\textstyle (a_1,b_1]$$ and $$\textstyle
(a_2,b_2]$$ are independent of each other, and this extends to any finite number of disjoint intervals.
In the queueing theory context, one can consider a point existing (in an interval) as an ''event'', but this
is different to the word event in the probability theory sense.  It follows that $$\textstyle \lambda$$ is the
expected number of ''arrivals'' that occur per unit of time, and it is sometimes called the ''rate
parameter''.

For a more formal definition of a stochastic process, such as a point process, one can use the Kolmogorov
theorem, which in this context gives the joint probability of some number of points existing in each disjoint
finite interval. More specifically, let $$\textstyle N(a_i,b_i]$$ denote the number of points of (a point
process) happening in the half-open interval $$\textstyle (a_i,b_i]$$, where the real numbers $$\textstyle
a_i<b_i\leq a_{i+1}$$. Then for some positive integer $$\textstyle k$$, the homogeneous Poisson point process on
the real line with parameter $$\textstyle \lambda>0$$ is defined with the finite-dimensional distribution:

$$
  P\{N(a_i,b_i]=n_i,  i=1, \dots, k\}=\prod_{i=1}^k\frac{[\lambda(b_i-a_i)]^{n_i}}{n_i!}e^{-\lambda(b_i-a_i)},
$$
